# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model capable of converting spoken language into text. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, resulting in a reliable ASR system suitable for real-time or offline transcription tasks.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asr-project.git
    cd asr-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Create a virtual environment and install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

4. **Open the Notebook**:
    Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `ASR_Project.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Data Description
The ASR model processes audio data in `.wav` or `.mp3` format, with each file having a corresponding transcription. The dataset structure:

- **Audio files**: Located in the `data/audio` folder.
- **Transcriptions**: Text files in `data/transcripts` folder, matching each audio file.

### Data Structure
Ensure the data is organized as follows:

```
asr-project/
├── data/
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── audio_file1.wav
│   │   ├── audio_file2.wav
│   ├── transcripts/
│       ├── transcript_file1.txt
│       ├── transcript_file2.txt
```

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing prepares the raw audio for model training:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Convert audio to spectrograms (e.g., Mel spectrograms).
    - Extract features like MFCCs, which are useful for speech recognition tasks.

2. **Noise Reduction**:
    - Apply noise reduction to clean the audio signal.

3. **Audio Resampling**:
    - Standardize the sample rate to ensure consistency across audio files.

These steps are implemented in `ASR_Project.ipynb` under the preprocessing section.

## Model Architecture
This ASR project utilizes a deep learning model optimized for audio-to-text conversion. Possible models include:

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: LSTM or GRU layers for sequential data processing.
- **Transformer-based Models**: Attention-based mechanisms for handling long audio sequences.
- **End-to-End ASR Models**: Architectures like Wav2Vec or DeepSpeech designed specifically for ASR tasks.

The model is built and trained using libraries like PyTorch and Hugging Face’s `transformers`.

### Libraries Used
- `torch` for model training.
- `librosa` for audio preprocessing.
- `transformers` for ASR-specific pre-trained models.

## Training and Evaluation
1. **Training**:
    - The ASR model is trained using a batch of preprocessed audio features and corresponding transcripts.
2. **Evaluation**:
    - **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Measures the transcription accuracy.
    - **Character Error Rate (CER)**: Useful for assessing ASR performance at the character level.

Training and evaluation procedures are included in `ASR_Project.ipynb`.

## Usage
To use the ASR model for transcription:

1. **Load Pre-trained Model** (if available).
2. **Run Preprocessing** on a sample audio file.
3. **Run Inference** to transcribe the audio.

Example in the notebook:
```python
# Load and preprocess an example audio file
preprocessed_audio = preprocess_audio("data/audio/sample_audio.wav")

# Run ASR model to transcribe
transcription = asr_model(preprocessed_audio)
print("Transcription:", transcription)
```

## Results
The project’s performance metrics:
- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Achieved XX% on test data.
- **Character Error Rate (CER)**: Achieved XX% on test data.

Detailed results are provided in the final sections of `ASR_Project.ipynb`.
